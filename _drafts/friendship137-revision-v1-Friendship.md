Friendship is one of the greatest bonds anyone can ever wish for. Lucky are those who have friends they can trust. Friendship is a devoted relationship between two individuals. They both feel immense care and love for each other. Usually, a friendship is shared by two people who have similar interests and feelings. We meet many along the way of life but only some stay with us forever. Those are our real friends, the ones who stay by our side through thick and thin. Friendship is the most beautiful gift we can present to anyone. It is one, which stays with us forever.

&nbsp;We are acquainted with many people in our life. However, the closest ones become our friends. We may have a large friend circle in school or college, but we know we can only count on one or two people with whom we share true friendship.

There are essentially two types of friends, one is good friends the other are true friends or best friends. They’re the ones with whom we have a special bond of love and affection. In other words, having a true friend makes our lives easier and full of happiness. Most importantly, true friendship stands for a relationship free of any judgments. In a true friendship,we can be ourselves completely without the fear of being judged. It makes us feel loved and accepted. This kind of freedom is what one strives to have in one’s life.

In short, true friendship is what gives us reason to stay strong in life. Having a loving family and all is okay but we also need true friendship to be completely happy. Some people don’t even have families but they have friends who’re like their family only. Thus,&nbsp; having true friends means a lot to everyone. Friendship is important in life because it teaches us a great deal about life. We learn so many lessons from friendship which we won’t find anywhere else. We learn to love someone other than our family. We know how to be ourselves in front of friends.

Friendship never leaves us in bad times. We learn how to understand people and trust others. Our real friends will always motivate us and cheer for us. They will take us on the right path and save us from any evil. Similarly, friendship also teaches we a lot about loyalty. It helps us to become loyal and get loyalty in return. There is no greater feeling in the world than having a friend who is loyal to us.

Moreover, friendship makes us stronger. It tests us and helps us grow. For instance, we see how we fight with our friends yet come back together after setting aside our differences. This is what makes us strong and teaches us patience.

Therefore, there is no doubt that best friends help us in our difficulties and bad times of life. They always try to save us in our dangers as well as offer timely advice. True friends are like the best assets of our life because they share our sorrow, sooth our pain and make us feel happy.
