<p>Friendship is one of the greatest bonds anyone can ever wish for. Lucky are those who have friends they can trust. Friendship is a devoted relationship between two individuals. They both feel immense care and love for each other. Usually, a friendship is shared by two people who have similar interests and feelings. We meet many along the way of life but only some stay with us forever. Those are our real friends, the ones who stay by our side through thick and thin. Friendship is the most beautiful gift we can present to anyone. It is one, which stays with us forever.</p>



<p>&nbsp;We are acquainted with many people in our life. However, the closest ones become our friends. We may have a large friend circle in school or college, but we know we can only count on one or two people with whom we share true friendship.</p>



<p>There are essentially two types of friends, one is good friends the other are true friends or best friends. They’re the ones with whom we have a special bond of love and affection. In other words, having a true friend makes our lives easier and full of happiness. Most importantly, true friendship stands for a relationship free of any judgments. In a true friendship,we can be ourselves completely without the fear of being judged. It makes us feel loved and accepted. This kind of freedom is what one strives to have in one’s life.</p>



<p>In short, true friendship is what gives us reason to stay strong in life. Having a loving family and all is okay but we also need true friendship to be completely happy. Some people don’t even have families but they have friends who’re like their family only. Thus,&nbsp; having true friends means a lot to everyone. Friendship is important in life because it teaches us a great deal about life. We learn so many lessons from friendship which we won’t find anywhere else. We learn to love someone other than our family. We know how to be ourselves in front of friends.</p>



<p>Friendship never leaves us in bad times. We learn how to understand people and trust others. Our real friends will always motivate us and cheer for us. They will take us on the right path and save us from any evil. Similarly, friendship also teaches we a lot about loyalty. It helps us to become loyal and get loyalty in return. There is no greater feeling in the world than having a friend who is loyal to us.</p>



<p>Moreover, friendship makes us stronger. It tests us and helps us grow. For instance, we see how we fight with our friends yet come back together after setting aside our differences. This is what makes us strong and teaches us patience.</p>



<p>Therefore, there is no doubt that best friends help us in our difficulties and bad times of life. They always try to save us in our dangers as well as offer timely advice. True friends are like the best assets of our life because they share our sorrow, sooth our pain and make us feel happy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The journey towards gender equality has existed for more than a century, tracing its roots from the suffragettes of the 19th century and the prehistoric attempts to reduce gender-based prejudice. Similar to other forms of discrimination, gender biases emanate from cultural beliefs and norms that &nbsp; organize human race into stereotypes and use the same stereotypes to determine capability, position as well as societal roles. Historically, the male stereotype has been applauded, assigned to certain roles both at home and at the workplace, leaving the females to only participate as subordinates hardly holding the leadership position. However, with the continued feminism actions, the line between gender roles continues to blur, with Hillary Clinton’s attempt to secure the presidential seat in the US marked as the greatest achievement.</p>



<p>In essence, accordance with the civilization of man, gender is expected to be a non-issue in assigning roles in the workplace. However, the practicability of this presumption remains adamant following the underlying traditions, perceptions, and beliefs that associate gender with individual capability. This paper analyses the issue of gender roles in the workplace in wide perspective incorporating the underlying beliefs, ever growing tensions, the conflicting theories about the issue in an effort to understand this intricate and belligerent discussion. In essence, as gender bias tends to diminish in the modern workplace, other attributes emerge necessitating or rather justifying gender prejudice making it a complex issue.</p>



<p>Among the many theories addressing the origin of gender roles, patriarchy takes a forefront despite having faced major criticism. According to the patriarchal spouses, both men and women have historically agreed on specific gender roles that typically improved the entire society&#8217;s welfare. Basically, during the pre-industrialization era, most communities survived from hunting and gathering &nbsp; an occupation that literally required the masculinity of a man. Therefore, men acquired the provider title in the family, and women typically became dependents of the male and thus rendering them more subordinates. Furthermore, human lifespan was short, and large families were considered as advantageous as they provided adequate labor and security required to protect the family. Therefore, women’s main task became &nbsp; giving birth to children and rearing them as well as taking care of other home based activities. in that perspective, Men became applauded as the dominant sex, were assigned other important tasks such as trading with other communities, negotiating for peace, or even waging wars, a trait that resulted in an increase in male prestige., with women roles being taken for granted.</p>



<p>Together with the males’ physical attributes, possibly the view that males are generally stronger than their women, and the perceived higher intellectual property, the patriarchy notion seems to have extended to the modern generation despite the changes in the human habitat environment.&nbsp; Furthermore, the chance to interact with other communities accorded to men, but denied to women, typically increased the intellectual capacity development gap. Men became relatively wiser, gained skills to tackle problems as women remained as subject to men’s decisions.</p>



<p>Though the environment has completely changed and the modern working environment mainly entails expertise rather than masculinity, the society still holds certain beliefs that define gender roles in favor of men.&nbsp; Basically, Men are considered as strong negotiators, and thus seem to fare well in positions that entail negotiations and hence making them seem fitter in executive positions. The notion that men can negotiate better than women thrives from the patriarchal theory, that presumes that men used to incapacitate more interactions with other communities giving them the necessary skills to make negotiations.</p>



<p>Moreover, Men are considered to be more confident and more willing to take risks. This trait presents in men that have led to male domination in entrepreneurial-related activities as well as acting as pioneers in almost every sector. Worth noting, most discoveries in the human race are made by men ranging from the inventions of the 19th century, such as printing the machine to internet inventions in the 20th and 21st inventions such as the Internet, social media networking among many others.&nbsp; Women have played the minority role in inventions with their major discoveries rotating around the home such as the Dishwasher discovered by Josephine Cochrane in 1886, Chocolate Chip Cookies invented by Ruth Wakefield and the solar Heated home system invented by Maria Telkes in the 1940s.</p>



<p>But then again, the female gender also has its strengths that make them better in some roles as compared to men. To start with, women tend to accept more challenges, probably due to the fact that society usually undermines their capability. According to a research, women are more hard working than men, are willing to take challenges, break normal working routines as well as tackle multiple tasks simultaneously. In accordance with the patriarchal theory, men are better placed for self-development while women’s comfort zone would entail being subordinate. Moreover, due to their poor negotiating skills, women tend to start at lower levels and are relatively lower salaried relative to their male counterparts.</p>



<p>But then again, women make better team players and are more receptive to team efforts, especially due to their ability to support leadership roles, or rather the ease of being ruled over as dictated by the patriarchal reasoning. Therefore, though men might hold major roles in the management, women are better placed in roles that require team efforts, especially those roles calling for persuasion and assertiveness. Basically, women relate better with clients, or rather strangers than men who seem to work better with the individuals they already know.&nbsp; With these stereotypical differences, the society has remained with a notion that embracing gender roles in jobs aren’t discrimination as such, but a strategic approach that firms may embrace to improve labor productivity and efficiency. In essence, the better an organization places best fitting individuals into their roles, the higher the chances of gaining a competitive advantage.</p>



<p>In contrast to the existing gender roles perception, the concept of gender equality especially in the workplace has been running concurrently. Gender equality calls for an equal chance or rather letting the environment determine individual capabilities and job positions via examining productivity and efficiency rather than holding historical and outdated perceptions of the patriarchal theories. The concept of gender equality has evoked varied presumptions among scholars, with the fact that women and men typically possess the same skills in management and other roles, with their differences only relating to building up perceptions. Generally, studies and practical campaigns on gender equality are aimed at eradicating gender roles in the workplace to bring forth benefits categorized into three levels; viz individual level, enterprise level and the national levels.</p>



<p>At individual level, proponents embrace the benefits of an egalitarianism system.&nbsp; According to Maslow’s theory of motivation, each individual regardless of their gender, social class or even race, aims at attaining self- actualization.&nbsp; In that sense both women and men need to be given equal opportunities, otherwise, the anticipation of fairness would be compromised. As a matter of fact, egalitarianism has existed in the prehistoric times especially in old Europe, with women and men participating equally in agricultural roles.The concept of patriarchy emanated from interaction between these societies, conflicts and especially invasion of the Ukrainian steppes that created the initial hierarchy that led to modern civilization and political systems. In essence, gender roles trace their roots to modern civilizations and political systems that have always applauded men’s capability, at the expense of women development, making them more perceptual but practical. But then again, in accordance with stereotypical differences discussed earlier, the practicability of gender equality in the workplace becomes debatable. Nevertheless, at the individual level, gender equality advocates the only request for equal opportunity and letting the environment do the ranking by itself.</p>



<p>Startlingly, gender equality at the national level has both empirically and theoretically proved to be beneficial, in the sense that the major goal at the national level is to enhance economic development that typically leads to improved social welfare of the entire society.&nbsp; Educating females, offering job opportunities as well as reducing gender-based barriers to career advancement has shown a strong correlation with improved country’s competitiveness. But then again, this entails equity rather than equality, where the nation utilizes the aforementioned female strengths to enhance productivity as they let men specialize on their best-fit roles.</p>



<p>In essence, women empowerment is considered as a tool to utilize the underutilized resources and thus ought to have a positive impact on economic growth, and therefore, national level benefits focus on the advantages of reducing male prejudice at the workplace. According to Conway (2012), empowering women and reducing women barriers, which literally implies eradicating the definition of gender roles, results in a reduction of the gap between male and female employment, and could yield up to 13% increment in the GDP as showcased by Goldman Sachs study on the Australian economy. This implies that gender roles might either be demeaning the economy, but on the other hand utilizing female labor does not imply replacing male labor but rather reducing resource underutilization by unlocking a hidden value, entailed in the female labor pool.</p>



<p>At the enterprise level, gender roles are prevalently discussed in line with the benefits that organizations derive from embracing gender equality relating to improved efficiency, productivity as well as gaining competitive advantage.&nbsp; Women leadership has been the main subject of discussion, provoking various scholars to empirically analyze the impact of women involvement in leadership on performance. Empirical studies show a correlation between women leadership and increased organizational performance, but the relationship is limited to just mere correlation as there is no proof of causality.</p>



<p>But then again, as the workplace changes to accommodate more women in leadership positions, there is a general improvement in overall productivity and efficiency, creating a weak argument that the patriarchal system that favored men in leadership positions might be fallacious. In essence, though men tend to appear stronger, or even entail a higher level of confidence, leadership roles in the modern organization barely require this trait. As a matter of fact, a high proportion of leadership capability is acquired, and women similar to men can generate strong leadership via experience and skill gathering. Therefore, equality in leadership positions calls for an equal chance between men and women, as augmenting that women are better of than men would also result in an unnecessary stereotyping &nbsp; that might bar objective judgment and untainted talent management.</p>



<p>All that said, gender biases and gender roles continue to dominate the modern workplace. According to a recent survey, the fight towards gender equality in the workplace has been partially fulfilled as the overall proportions approach a half, but the proportion of males in top positions remains higher than 90%. Most legal barriers to women rising to executive positions have been eradicated, but the trend of increasing women in such positions remains adamant. Basically, there exists a glass ceiling, or rather an artificial barrier that makes it hard for women to raise to their posts. Among the main causes of the glass ceiling, does the patriarchal mentality exist in both women and men that make women pursue careers not likely to award them promotions. As a matter of fact, organizational positions such as secretaries, customer care assistants, and other subordinate duties tend to accommodate more women and curb their progress career-wise. Worse though, even those individuals in mainstream job positions&nbsp; are paid less than their male counterparts and hence may feel as less fit, reducing their intrinsic motivation to search for top positions.</p>



<p>Struggle towards gender equality faces various challenges that can be easily explained using the concept of invisibility. Worth noting, gender-based movements have existed for such a long time, and have succeeded to completely streamline the legal system to eradicate all barriers. However, the mental cognition of individuals, remain retardant into accommodating these adjustments and hence in response develop repulsive traits that reduce the practical effectiveness of gender equality moves. Basically, the term gender equality struggle has always been used to imply a fight towards improving the social status of ladies, especially in the workplace.</p>



<p>Thus, gender issues have turned to reflect female issues and gender equality rendered a feminist agenda in which men need to play very little. In that sense, women are left to struggle to make their own progress, men play a retardant role and let the environment do its selection. By doing this, men become oblivious of gender, and as a result become invisible players in the struggle towards gender equality. Consequently, the invisibility of men in the field has led to the invisibility of the underlying problem and hence combating the entire gender bias problem present in the workplace. In essence, men are in denial of the existence of the patriarchal system in the 21st century and blame women for not taking the awarded opportunities, a mentality that has led to an increased number of women retaining subordinate jobs where they feel more comfortable.</p>



<p>The recruitment process, promotion, and salaries have played a significant role in enhancing gender inequality in the workplace. Despite efforts put forth by gender equality activists, chauvinism seems to dominate these three factors that place women at different positions to men in the workplace.&nbsp; As noted earlier, cultural stereotypes are used to define capabilities, and thus recruiters tend to adhere to these chauvinist ideologies, disregarding equality in skills. For instance, in many elective posts, most countries advocate for a 2/3 gender role but tend to focus on enlightening ladies to fulfill the third.&nbsp; Moreover, the recruitment of women to job positions increases less proportionately relative to the rise in educational skill attainment. Promotions and salaries enhancements show a similar trend, enhancing the inferiority of women at the workplace.</p>



<p>In a nutshell, gender roles have existed in the human race cutting through social, cultural, economic and political organisations. Basically, the patriarchal system that applauds man as the dominant sex, plays a major role in defining gender roles. The patriarchal system was adopted in the historic times when the environmental system required the masculinity of a man to provide and protect the society, while women remained subordinate to men and focused on family-related chores. Though the environment has adversely evolved, the perceived male domination has barely changed and women and men in the modern world still align to these traditional presumptions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Epidemic is a situation when new cases of a particular disease exceed the level of normally recorded in the area during the same period. Pandemic is an unusually strong epidemic spread in the countries and continents. This is the highest level of the epidemic process.</p>



<p>Pandemics of ancient times devastated cities and countries. There were three largest pandemics of plague, at least 7 known to science pandemics of cholera, the first of which began in the early 19th century, the last – in the middle of the 20th century. In the past such infectious diseases as smallpox, malaria, typhus, and others often took pandemic character.<br>No less famous are influenza pandemics. In 1580 influenza swept Asia, Europe and America. In the 18th century there were seven pandemics of influenza. In the 20th century so-called “Spanish flu” was recorded in Europe, Russia, America, China and India. It took the lives of 20 million people. It is not excluded that the “Spanish flu” began in animals and then was transferred to humans. In the 20th century there were other influenza pandemics: the “Asian flu” 1958-59, “Hong Kong flu” 1968-67, “Russian flu” 1977-78.</p>



<p>Scientific and economic opportunities in the fight against epidemics are of great importance in the spread of infectious diseases. Advances in medicine and related sciences, scientific validity of the epidemic control activities, emergence of specific methods of prevention (vaccines) have resulted in the fact that the pandemic spread of infectious diseases by the mid 20th century has practically ceased.</p>



<p>But recently a new virus named “COVID-19” abbreviated from “Coronavirus disease 2019” is spreading across the globe. This is a large scale epidemic which is spreading at an alarmingly fast rate. It is on the verge of being declared a pandemic. At the time of writing, there is no possible cure. The only possible solution is to quarantine the patients and wait for them to recover. Scientists and researchers all over the globe are working to find a cure but in vain. We are no close to finding a cure than we were at the start of this epidemic. However, this does not mean that no one recovers from this disease. In retrospect, the number of recoveries is a lot more than the number of deaths. At the time of writing, there are a total of 17,77,515 active cases of COVID-19 across the globe with 1,08,862 deaths and 4,04,236 recoveries.</p>



<p>Doctors and researchers around the world are trying to figure out exactly how the virus has spread to certain areas, and so quickly. It started out as strictly travel-related, meaning people who had recently been to the Wuhan area in China were becoming infected. But the world is so interconnected, so with so much travel happening, it can be difficult to trace some of the cases. It’s plausible that with international travel, someone transmitted the virus without knowing they had it.</p>



<p>COVID-19 mostly affects the upper respiratory system, but symptoms present differently depending on the severity of the case. Some people have very mild symptoms, similar to cold symptoms, like a runny nose.<br>But some cases of coronavirus are more serious than a common cold. The symptoms might be similar to the flu, in terms of high fever, aches and pains, and cough. In some cases, people are developing pneumonia with the virus, though the most severe symptoms are impacting people over 50 who have pre-existing respiratory conditions, meaning their immune system is compromised. The main way the virus is spread is through respiratory droplets (aka coughs and sneezes), which can travel to other people through the air or through your hands, hence there is a worldwide plea for people to wash their hands more frequently, as well as take other precautions.</p>



<p>Many of the world’s governments are being scrutinized for their slow and unenthusiastic responses to the COVID-19 outbreaks. Especially in countries with more authoritarian government structures ,such as China, the effects of coronavirus may lead to widespread political dissatisfaction among citizens. This scrutiny is likely to have few consequences in many of the world’s countries, but it may lead to big change in others. Coronavirus may also lead to changes in trade, for numerous reasons. For example, as coronavirus continues to sweep the world, many countries will realize the dependence of their supply chains on others’. Particular supply chains that have been disrupted include those of medical-grade facial masks. In the future, some countries may wish to begin to manufacture masks internally so as to be better prepared for new disease outbreaks.<br>A major Economic consequence of the coronavirus outbreak is poor market performance. This has already been observed in many of the world’s biggest financial markets, such as those of China and the United States, and is only expected to continue as the outbreak matures. There are fears that this poor market performance may lead to a multi-year recession, as investors pull their money out of traditional financial instruments to hedge themselves against market volatility. As more individuals fall ill, coronavirus is likely to lead to a temporary lack of workers. Whether this is due to quarantines or workers making the decision to stay home, the end result is the same: companies and governments will be pressed to find laborers. This is likely to result in reduced Economic output, as business grinds to a halt for many.</p>



<p>As with any worldwide outbreak of disease, coronavirus is very likely to (and already has, in some places) result in panic. This panic is visible on many levels. For example, with citizens anticipating a need to stay home for extended periods of time, they may rush to supermarkets to stock up on home goods such as food, water, and toilet paper. This will exacerbate the temporary disruption of many supply chains. Panic may also cause individuals to stock up on fuel for their vehicles, or take other anticipatory measures.</p>



<p>Perhaps an unexpected Sociocultural consequence of the coronavirus outbreak is unusual amounts of racism. Since coronavirus was believed to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, some individuals became prejudiced to Chinese or Asian-looking individuals in their local areas. In fact, this even resulted in some physical assaults. As the disease crosses new borders, it’s likely that this will fade. However, some individuals may continue to carry prejudices for the initial spread of the virus.</p>



<p>Coronavirus is sure to result in numerous advances in virology — the study of viruses. The nature and spread of the virus will prove invaluable information to scientists looking to better understand how this pathogen, and others like it, can be contained and treated. With any luck, the coronavirus outbreak will spur the world’s many great minds to find new ways to manage pandemic situations. An existing example of this is the creation of drive-thru testing centers, which enable citizens to test themselves for the virus without exposing themselves to a hospital full of patients.</p>



<p>Since many individuals will be unable to go to work during the coronavirus outbreak, some companies may choose to encourage remote work, if applicable to their line of work. For example, some office workers might be able to fulfill their duties from home, without the need to travel to and work at an office everyday (which carries the risk of further spreading coronavirus). While this is a short-term change, it may encourage companies to allow remote work in the future, if the concept proves itself.<br>Coronavirus is bound to affect our world in a whole variety of ways. Politically, the virus is bound to cause the scrutinization of some governments and may also impact international trade. Economically, the virus has already resulted in suboptimal market performance. There is also a temporary lack of workers, directly causing reduced economic output (which may be one of the reasons for suboptimal performance). Socioculturally, the virus has multiple consequences: panic, racism and an opportunity for remote work to shine. Finally, the primary Technological consequence of coronavirus is a collection of advances in virology.</p>



<p>All in all, coronavirus is affecting the world in many negative ways. Causing Political, Economic, and Sociocultural distress, the deadly pathogen will call for careful management to minimize these issues. The only real positives of the situation, however, are the rise in medical technology, and possibly the popularity of working from home.</p>

<p>The rhythmic combination of the three disciplines, namely-:</p>



<p><strong>Vocal-:</strong> The art of singing.</p>



<p><strong>Instrumental-:</strong> The art of playing any instrument.</p>



<p><strong>Dance-:</strong> The art of expression.</p>



<p>is called music.</p>



<h2>History of music</h2>



<h3>Prehistoric music-:</h3>



<p>The earliest forms of music were probably drum-based, percussion instruments being the most readily available at the time (i.e. rocks, sticks). These simplest of simple instruments are thought to have been used in religious ceremonies as representations of animals. There was no notation or writing of this kind of &#8220;music&#8221; and its sounds can only be extrapolated from the music of (South) American Indians and African natives who still adhere to some of the ancient religious practices.</p>



<p>As for the more advanced instruments, their evolution was slow and steady. It is known that by 4000 BCE the Egyptians had created harps and flutes, and by 3500 BCE lyres and double-reeded clarinets had been developed. In Denmark, by 2500 BCE an early form of the trumpet had been developed. This trumpet is what is now known as a &#8220;natural trumpet.&#8221; It is valveless, and depends completely on manipulation of the lips to change pitch. One of the most popular instruments today was created in 1500 BCE by the Hittites. I am talking about the guitar. This was a great step; the use of frets to change the pitch of a vibrating string would lead to later instruments such as the violin and harpsichord.</p>



<p>In 800 BCE the first recovered piece of recorded music was found. It was written in cuneiform and was a religious hymn. It should be noted that cuneiform is not a type of musical notation. By 700 BCE there are records of songs that include vocals with instrumentals. This added a whole new dimension to music: accompaniment.</p>



<h3>Music in ancient Rome and Greece-:</h3>



<p>Greece was the root of all Classical art, so it&#8217;s no coincidence that Classical music is rooted in Grecian innovations. In 600 BCE, famed mathematician Pythagorus dissected music as a science and developed the keystone of modern music: the octave scale. The importance of this event is obvious. Music was a passion of the Greeks. With their surplus of leisure time (thanks to slave labor) they were able to cultivate great artistic skills. Trumpet competitions were common spectator events in Greece by 400 BCE. It was in Greece that the first bricks in music theory&#8217;s foundation were layed. Aristotle wrote on music theory scientifically, and brought about a method of notation in 350 BCE. The work of that genius is still studied today. The next significant step in music&#8217;s evolution was by Boethius. In 521 CE he brought the Greek system of notation to Western Europe, allowing the musicians there to scribe accurately the folk songs of their lands. Incidentally, it was Boethius who first wrote on the idea of the opera.</p>



<h3>Music in the middle ages-:</h3>



<p>Most of the music created after Rome fell was commissioned by the church. The Catholic religion has a long history of involvement (for better or worse) with the musical arts. In 600 CE Pope Gregory had the Schola Cantarum built. This was the first music school in Europe. Meanwhile in China, music was progressing also: it was reported that in 612 CE there were orchestras with hundreds of musicians performing for the assorted dynasties. Although the specific music from this period in China is unknown, the distinct style supposed to have developed there is reflected even in recent orchestral Asiatic pieces.</p>



<p>In 650 CE a new system of writing music was developed using &#8220;neumes&#8221; as a notation for groups of notes in music. 144 years after the Schola Cantarum was built, a singing school opened in the Monastery of Fuda, fueling the interest in musical vocation. And by 790 CE, there were splinters of the Schola Cantarum in Paris, Cologne and Metz. In 800 CE the great unifier Charlemagne had poems and psalms set to music. In 850 CE Catholic musicians had a breakthrough by inventing the church &#8220;modes.&#8221; These modes would later metamorphose into today&#8217;s major and minor scales. In 855 CE, the first polyphonic (2 unrelated melodies/voices at once) piece was recorded, and by 1056 this polyphonic style replaced Gregorian chants as the music of choice (even after the Church made polyphonic music &#8220;illegal&#8221;; this ban was later lifted). In 980 CE, the great tome Antiphononium Codex Montpellier was scribed.</p>



<p>In 1000 CE Guido D&#8217;Arezzo made many improvements in music theory. He first improved and reworked standard notation to be more user-friendly by adding time signatures. Then he invented solfege. This is the vocal note scale: do, re, mi, fa, so, la ,ti, do. This innovation has affected almost every modern vocalist. In 1100 CE, a new secular movement began. This separation of Church from music was a straddling one, and soon this new &#8220;folk&#8221; music was looked down upon as pagan and borderline blasphemous.</p>



<h3>Music in the Renaissance-:</h3>



<p>The beginning of the Renaissance in music is not as clearly marked as the beginning of the Renaissance in the other arts, and unlike in the other arts, it did not begin in Italy, but in northern Europe, specifically in the area currently comprising central and northern France, the Netherlands, and Belgium. The style of the Burgundian composers, as the first generation of the Franco-Flemish school is known, was at first a reaction against the excessive complexity and mannered style of the late 14th century ars subtilior, and contained clear, singable melody and balanced polyphony in all voices. The most famous composers of the Burgundian school in the mid-15th century are Guillaume Dufay, Gilles Binchois, and Antoine Busnois.</p>



<p>By the middle of the 15th century, composers and singers from the Low Countries and adjacent areas began to spread across Europe, especially into Italy, where they were employed by the papal chapel and the aristocratic patrons of the arts (such as the Medici, the Este, and the Sforza families). They carried their style with them: smooth polyphony which could be adapted for sacred or secular use as appropriate. Principal forms of sacred musical composition at the time were the mass, the motet, and the laude; secular forms included the chanson, the frottola, and later the madrigal.</p>



<p>The invention of printing had an immense influence on the dissemination of musical styles, and along with the movement of the Franco-Flemish musicians, contributed to the establishment of the first truly international style in European music since the unification of Gregorian chant under Charlemagne.Composers of the middle generation of the Franco-Flemish school included Johannes Ockeghem, who wrote music in a contrapuntally complex style, with varied texture and an elaborate use of canonical devices; Jacob Obrecht, one of the most famous composers of masses in the last decades of the 15th century; and Josquin des Prez, probably the most famous composer in Europe before Palestrina, and who during the 16th century was renowned as one of the greatest artists in any form. Music in the generation after Josquin explored increasing complexity of counterpoint; possibly the most extreme expression is in the music of Nicolas Gombert, whose contrapuntal complexities influenced early instrumental music, such as the canzona and the ricercar, ultimately culminating in Baroque fugal forms.</p>



<p>By the middle of the 16th century, the international style began to break down, and several highly diverse stylistic trends became evident: a trend towards simplicity in sacred music, as directed by the Counter-Reformation Council of Trent, exemplified in the music of Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina; a trend towards complexity and chromaticism in the madrigal, which reached its extreme expression in the avant-garde style of the Ferrara School of Luzzaschi and the late century madrigalist Carlo Gesualdo; and the grandiose, sonorous music of the Venetian school, which used the architecture of the Basilica San Marco di Venezia to create antiphonal contrasts. The music of the Venetian school included the development of orchestration, ornamented instrumental parts, and continuo bass parts, all of which occurred within a span of several decades around 1600. Famous composers in Venice included the Gabrielis, Andrea and Giovanni, as well as Claudio Monteverdi, one of the most significant innovators at the end of the era.</p>



<p>Most parts of Europe had active and well-differentiated musical traditions by late in the century. In England, composers such as Thomas Tallis and William Byrd wrote sacred music in a style similar to that written on the continent, while an active group of home-grown madrigalists adapted the Italian form for English tastes: famous composers included Thomas Morley, John Wilbye and Thomas Weelkes. Spain developed instrumental and vocal styles of its own, with Tomás Luis de Victoria writing refined music similar to that of Palestrina, and numerous other composers writing for the new guitar. Germany cultivated polyphonic forms built on the Protestant chorales, which replaced the Roman Catholic Gregorian Chant as a basis for sacred music, and imported the style of the Venetian school (the appearance of which defined the start of the Baroque era there). In addition, German composers wrote enormous amounts of organ music, establishing the basis for the later Baroque organ style which culminated in the work of J.S. Bach. France developed a unique style of musical diction known as musique mesurée, used in secular chansons, with composers such as Guillaume Costeley and Claude Le Jeune prominent in the movement.</p>



<p>One of the most revolutionary movements in the era took place in Florence in the 1570s and 1580s, with the work of the Florentine Camerata, who ironically had a reactionary intent: dissatisfied with what they saw as contemporary musical depravities, their goal was to restore the music of the ancient Greeks. Chief among them were Vincenzo Galilei, the father of the astronomer, and Giulio Caccini. The fruits of their labors was a declamatory melodic singing style known as monody, and a corresponding staged dramatic form: a form known today as opera. The first operas, written around 1600, also define the end of the Renaissance and the beginning of the Baroque eras.</p>



<p>Music prior to 1600 was modal rather than tonal. Several theoretical developments late in the 16th century, such as the writings on scales on modes by Gioseffo Zarlino and Franchinus Gaffurius, led directly to the development of common practice tonality. The major and minor scales began to predominate over the old church modes, a feature which was at first most obvious at cadential points in compositions, but gradually became pervasive. Music after 1600, beginning with the tonal music of the Baroque era, is often referred to as belonging to the common practice period.</p>



<h3>Indian music-:</h3>



<p>In India, the origin of music, indeed sound itself is traced back to the origin of the universe. According to Hindu mythology, the first ever sound is the Naadbrahma (Brhma as Sound), which pervades the entire universe. It is the purest sound in the universe and is believed to be unstruck. Another myth associates the origin of sound (and dance) with the Tandava of Shiva and Omkar. It is said that sage Narada then introduced the art of music to the earth from heaven. Origin of the music in India was in devotional songs and was restricted to religious and ritualistic purposes and was mainly used in temples only. This then developed in association with folk music and other musical forms of India and gradually derived its own musical characteristics. </p>



<h4>In ancient India</h4>



<p>The history of music in India can be traced back to the Vedic times. The concept of Naadbrahma was prevalent in the Vedic ages. All organised music traces its origins back to the Sam Veda which contains the earliest known form of organised music. The earliest raga owes its origin to the Sam Ved. During the late Vedic Period, music prevailed in the form called Samgana, which was purely a chanting of the verses in musical patterns. After that music changed its course a little bit. The epics were narrated in musical tones called `Jatigan.` Between the second to the seventh century AD, a form of music called `Prabandh Sangeet`, written in&nbsp; Sanskrit became very popular. This form gave rise to a simpler form called Dhruvapad, which used Hindi as the medium.</p>



<p>The first reference to music was made by Panini in 500 BC and the first reference to musical theory is found in `Rikpratisakhya` in 400 BC. Bharata’s Natyashastra (4th century AD), contains several chapters on music, which was probably the first clear written work on music that has divided music into octaves and twenty-two keys. The next important work on music is `Dathilan` that also mentions the existence of twenty-two srutis per octave. According to ancient notion, only these twenty-two srutis can be made by the human beings. Two other important works written during this period were `Brihaddesi` written by Matanga in 9th century AD, which attempts to define Raga and `Sangeeta Makaranda; written by Narada in 11<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century AD, which enumerates ninety-three Raagas and classifies them into masculine and feminine species.</p>



<h4>In medieval India</h4>



<p>In the medieval period, the nature of Indian music underwent a change due to the impact of the Muslim influence. At this time, Indian music slowly started branching off into the two distinct forms of Hindustani and Carnatic music. These two traditions of music started to diverge only around 14th century AD. The Persian influence brought a substantial change in the Northern style of Indian music. In the fifteenth century AD, the devotional Dhruvapad transformed into the Dhrupad or classical form of singing. The Khayal developed as a new form of singing in the eighteenth century AD. Carnatic classical or kriti is mainly based on the Saahitya or lyric oriented, while Hindustani music emphasizes on the musical structure. Hindustani music adopted a scale of Shudha Swara Saptaka or Octave of natural notes while Carnatic music retains the style of traditional octave. Both Hindustani and Carnatic music express great assimilative power, also absorbing folk tunes and regional characteristics as well as elevating many of these tunes to the status of ragas. Thus, these two systems of music have mutually influenced each other.</p>



<h4>In modern India</h4>



<p>With the advent of the British in India, the court arts underwent a decline. Since most of the nawabs and noblemen lost their wealth and did not have the rewards to lavish on performers, most of the musicians had to move over to other occupations. A few gharanas did however manage to survive and continued. However, on the whole, Indian music took a backseat and interest and resources to sustain this art started to fade. A parallel development that gradually started forming at this time was that newer forms of media were now emerging.. Thus, with the advent of television, radio etc western influences started creeping into Indian music. There was the spread of popular or `pop` music and this trend increased with the spread of cinema. Classical music too started being exported out of the country in the 60`s, and an experiment of combining western music with the Indian Classical form also took place. This gave rise to what is popularly referred to as fusion music. In the 70`s and 80`s disco and pop music entered the Indian musical scene. The 90`s further popularised the pop trend among the Indian audiences. With the further spread of information technology and an increasingly global world, we see a host of musical forms existing in contemporary India—rock, Hip-hop, jazz etc. Apart from these western forms of music, traditional forms of Indian music, such as Khayal, Ghazal, Geet, Thumri, Qawwali etc. also find place in the contemporary music. Bhajans and Kirtans, which form a separate stream of religious songs, are also quite widely sung across the country. During all this historical development of music in India, Folk Music continued to keep its existence side by side classical music.</p>
