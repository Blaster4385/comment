Epidemic is a situation when new cases of a particular disease exceed the level of normally recorded in the area during the same period. Pandemic is an unusually strong epidemic spread in the countries and continents. This is the highest level of the epidemic process.

Pandemics of ancient times devastated cities and countries. There were three largest pandemics of plague, at least 7 known to science pandemics of cholera, the first of which began in the early 19th century, the last – in the middle of the 20th century. In the past such infectious diseases as smallpox, malaria, typhus, and others often took pandemic character.  
No less famous are influenza pandemics. In 1580 influenza swept Asia, Europe and America. In the 18th century there were seven pandemics of influenza. In the 20th century so-called “Spanish flu” was recorded in Europe, Russia, America, China and India. It took the lives of 20 million people. It is not excluded that the “Spanish flu” began in animals and then was transferred to humans. In the 20th century there were other influenza pandemics: the “Asian flu” 1958-59, “Hong Kong flu” 1968-67, “Russian flu” 1977-78.

Scientific and economic opportunities in the fight against epidemics are of great importance in the spread of infectious diseases. Advances in medicine and related sciences, scientific validity of the epidemic control activities, emergence of specific methods of prevention (vaccines) have resulted in the fact that the pandemic spread of infectious diseases by the mid 20th century has practically ceased.

But recently a new virus named “COVID-19” abbreviated from “Coronavirus disease 2019” is spreading across the globe. This is a large scale epidemic which is spreading at an alarmingly fast rate. It is on the verge of being declared a pandemic. At the time of writing, there is no possible cure. The only possible solution is to quarantine the patients and wait for them to recover. Scientists and researchers all over the globe are working to find a cure but in vain. We are no close to finding a cure than we were at the start of this epidemic. However, this does not mean that no one recovers from this disease. In retrospect, the number of recoveries is a lot more than the number of deaths. At the time of writing, there are a total of 17,77,515 active cases of COVID-19 across the globe with 1,08,862 deaths and 4,04,236 recoveries.

Doctors and researchers around the world are trying to figure out exactly how the virus has spread to certain areas, and so quickly. It started out as strictly travel-related, meaning people who had recently been to the Wuhan area in China were becoming infected. But the world is so interconnected, so with so much travel happening, it can be difficult to trace some of the cases. It’s plausible that with international travel, someone transmitted the virus without knowing they had it.

COVID-19 mostly affects the upper respiratory system, but symptoms present differently depending on the severity of the case. Some people have very mild symptoms, similar to cold symptoms, like a runny nose.  
But some cases of coronavirus are more serious than a common cold. The symptoms might be similar to the flu, in terms of high fever, aches and pains, and cough. In some cases, people are developing pneumonia with the virus, though the most severe symptoms are impacting people over 50 who have pre-existing respiratory conditions, meaning their immune system is compromised. The main way the virus is spread is through respiratory droplets (aka coughs and sneezes), which can travel to other people through the air or through your hands, hence there is a worldwide plea for people to wash their hands more frequently, as well as take other precautions.

Many of the world’s governments are being scrutinized for their slow and unenthusiastic responses to the COVID-19 outbreaks. Especially in countries with more authoritarian government structures ,such as China, the effects of coronavirus may lead to widespread political dissatisfaction among citizens. This scrutiny is likely to have few consequences in many of the world’s countries, but it may lead to big change in others. Coronavirus may also lead to changes in trade, for numerous reasons. For example, as coronavirus continues to sweep the world, many countries will realize the dependence of their supply chains on others’. Particular supply chains that have been disrupted include those of medical-grade facial masks. In the future, some countries may wish to begin to manufacture masks internally so as to be better prepared for new disease outbreaks.  
A major Economic consequence of the coronavirus outbreak is poor market performance. This has already been observed in many of the world’s biggest financial markets, such as those of China and the United States, and is only expected to continue as the outbreak matures. There are fears that this poor market performance may lead to a multi-year recession, as investors pull their money out of traditional financial instruments to hedge themselves against market volatility. As more individuals fall ill, coronavirus is likely to lead to a temporary lack of workers. Whether this is due to quarantines or workers making the decision to stay home, the end result is the same: companies and governments will be pressed to find laborers. This is likely to result in reduced Economic output, as business grinds to a halt for many.

As with any worldwide outbreak of disease, coronavirus is very likely to (and already has, in some places) result in panic. This panic is visible on many levels. For example, with citizens anticipating a need to stay home for extended periods of time, they may rush to supermarkets to stock up on home goods such as food, water, and toilet paper. This will exacerbate the temporary disruption of many supply chains. Panic may also cause individuals to stock up on fuel for their vehicles, or take other anticipatory measures.

Perhaps an unexpected Sociocultural consequence of the coronavirus outbreak is unusual amounts of racism. Since coronavirus was believed to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, some individuals became prejudiced to Chinese or Asian-looking individuals in their local areas. In fact, this even resulted in some physical assaults. As the disease crosses new borders, it’s likely that this will fade. However, some individuals may continue to carry prejudices for the initial spread of the virus.

Coronavirus is sure to result in numerous advances in virology — the study of viruses. The nature and spread of the virus will prove invaluable information to scientists looking to better understand how this pathogen, and others like it, can be contained and treated. With any luck, the coronavirus outbreak will spur the world’s many great minds to find new ways to manage pandemic situations. An existing example of this is the creation of drive-thru testing centers, which enable citizens to test themselves for the virus without exposing themselves to a hospital full of patients.

Since many individuals will be unable to go to work during the coronavirus outbreak, some companies may choose to encourage remote work, if applicable to their line of work. For example, some office workers might be able to fulfill their duties from home, without the need to travel to and work at an office everyday (which carries the risk of further spreading coronavirus). While this is a short-term change, it may encourage companies to allow remote work in the future, if the concept proves itself.  
Coronavirus is bound to affect our world in a whole variety of ways. Politically, the virus is bound to cause the scrutinization of some governments and may also impact international trade. Economically, the virus has already resulted in suboptimal market performance. There is also a temporary lack of workers, directly causing reduced economic output (which may be one of the reasons for suboptimal performance). Socioculturally, the virus has multiple consequences: panic, racism and an opportunity for remote work to shine. Finally, the primary Technological consequence of coronavirus is a collection of advances in virology.

All in all, coronavirus is affecting the world in many negative ways. Causing Political, Economic, and Sociocultural distress, the deadly pathogen will call for careful management to minimize these issues. The only real positives of the situation, however, are the rise in medical technology, and possibly the popularity of working from home.
